CONSTRUCTORS:

 - Like methods, Constructors contains block of statements or codes.
 - Constructor name should be the same as the class name.
 
Example:

class Student{  
    int id;  
    String name;  
    //creating a constructor  
    Student(int i,String n){  
    id = i;  
    name = n;  
    }  
    //method to display the values  
    void display(){System.out.println(id+" "+name);}  
   
    public static void main(String args[]){  
    //creating objects and passing values  
    Student4 s1 = new Student4(111,"Karan");  
    s1.display();  
   }  
}  

 Constructor overloading:
  - It is like having two or more constructors inside the class.
  - The constructors name should be same as the class name irrespective of the number of constructors.
