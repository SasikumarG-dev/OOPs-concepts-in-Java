INHERITANCE:

 - One object that acquires all the properties and behavior of the parent object.
 - It is also known as IS-A relationship or Parent-Child relationship.
 - 'extends' keyword is used to increase functionality.
 - Create new class upon existing class.
 
Example:

class Bike{  
void ride(){System.out.println("riding...");}  
}  
class pulsar extends Bike{  
void race(){System.out.println("racing...");}  
}  
class Inheritance{  
public static void main(String args[]){  
Bike d=new Bike();  
d.race();  
d.ride();  
}
}  

OUTPUT:
racing...
riding...

Types of Inheritance:

i) Single Inheritance
     When a class inherits another class it is called single inheritance.
  
ii) Multilevel Inheritance
    It is chain of inheritance.
    Example:
     class Animal
     class Dog extends Animal
     class BabyDog extends Animal
     
iii) Hierarchical Inheritance
    When two or more class inherits the same class it is called Hierarchical inheritance.
    Example:
    class Animal
    class Dog extends Animal
    class Cat extends Animal
    
    
Q) Why Multiple inheritance is not used in Java?
     - To reduce time complexity and to simplify the language.
     - Java renders compile-time error when two classes inherits
     Example:
     class Animal
    class Dog extends Animal
    class Cat extends Dog,Animal
    - It is not possible to inherit two classes.
