METHOD:
 - A group of codes or block of codes that performs specific operations.
 - It is a function used to expose behavior of object.
 - Default method in java is main method.
 
 Advantages:
  > Code reusability
  > Code optimization
  
 Example:
 
 //method declaration
 public static void EvenOdd(int num)  
{  
//method body  
if(num%2==0)   
System.out.println(num+" is even");   
else   
System.out.println(num+" is odd");  
}  


* In the above example Public is Access modifier, void is the return type, EvenOdd is the method name, int num is the parameter list.

Access modifiers:
 1. PUBLIC - Methods are accessible in all class in the java package
 2. PROTECTED - Methods are accessible within the same package or subclasses in different packages.
 3. PRIVATE - Method is accessible only in class where it is declared.
 4. Default - When no access modifier is specified in the class, it is said to have default access modifiers. Default access modifier are accessible only within the same package.
 
 
              
  Access modifiers                                            Public          Protected          Private          Default
 
  Accessible inside class                                       YES             YES                YES              YES
  
  Accessible inside subclass inside same package                YES             YES                NO               YES
  
  Accessible outside package                                    YES             NO                 NO               NO
  
  Accessible within subclass outside the package                YES             YES                NO               NO
  
  
  Return type:
   - It is the data type that the method returns.
   - Example - int, String, long, float, etc..
   - If the method does not return anything use void keyword.
   
  Method name:
   - A unique name that defines the name of the method.
   - It is better to use CamelCase to define a method for better understanding and readability.
   - Example - AddTwoNumbers()
   
   Parameter list:
   - It is the list of parameters separated by a comma and enclosed in the pair of parentheses().
   - It conatins datatypes(int) and variable name (num).
  
   Method body:
   - The code that are written inside the method.
   - Enclosed with curly braces{}.
