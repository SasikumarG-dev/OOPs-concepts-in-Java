AGGREGATION:

 - A class contain the reference of the another class.
 - Aggregation represents HAS-A relationship.
 - It is used for code reusability.
 - It is known as Composition.
 
Example:

public class Address {  
String city;
String state;
String country;  
public Address(String city, String state, String country) {  
    this.city = city;  
    this.state = state;  
    this.country = country;  
}  
  
} 
public class Emp {  
int id;  
String name;  
Address address;
// code written...
....
....

}


CODING:

package aggregations;
//Employee class HAS-A relationship of Address class
class Address{
    int doorNo;
    String place;
    String country;
    Address(int no,String place,String country){
        this.doorNo=no;
        this.place=place;
        this.country=country;
    }
}
class Details{
    int id;
    String name;
    Address address;
    Details(int id,String name,Address address){
        this.id=id;
        this.name=name;
        this.address=address;
    }
    void display(){
        System.out.println(id+" "+name+" "+address.doorNo+" "
                +address.place+" "+address.country);
    }
}
public class Aggregations {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Address obj=new Address(47,"Pondy","India");
        Details obj1=new Details(1,"SasiKumar",obj);
        obj1.display();
    }
    
}

OUTPUT:
1 SasiKumar 47 Pondy India
