POLYMORPHISM:

 - It is concept to perform single action in different ways.
 - It is derived from two Geek words 'Poly' and 'Morphs'.
 - Poly means many and Morphs means forms.

Types of Polymorphism:

i) Method overloading or Compile time polymorphism

  - Method overloading is having multiple methods of same name but having different parameters.
  - Method overloading is done by 
      *Changing number of arguments
      Example:
      // multiple methods of same name
      Adder.add(11,12);    --> 2 arguments
      Adder.add(11,22,33); --> 3 arguments
      
      *Changing type of arguments
      Example:
      form.add(11,12);     -->(int ,int)
      form.add(11,"sasi"); -->(int ,Stirng)
      
ii) Method overriding or Runtime polymorphism

  -  If a subclass have same method declared in the parent class then it is called Method overriding.
  -  In method overriding it depends on which object you called to invoke the method in the class.
  Example:
  //crearting parent class
  class Vehicle{  
  //defining a method  
  void run(){System.out.println("Vehicle is running");}  
}  
//Creating a child class  
class Bike2 extends Vehicle{  
  //defining the same method as in the parent class  
  void run(){System.out.println("Bike is running safely");}  
  
  public static void main(String args[]){  
  Bike2 obj = new Bike2();//creating object for child class 
  Vehicle veh= new Vehicle()// creating object for parent class
  veh.run();//calling parent method
  obj.run();//calling child method  
  }  
}  

OUTPUT:
Vehicle is running
Bike is running safely
