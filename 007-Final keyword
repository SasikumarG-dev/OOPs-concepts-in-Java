FINAL:

 - It is used to restrict the user.
 - It can be used in variables, methods and class.
 - If any variable is declared as final then the values in it cannot be changed.
 - If any method is declared as final then method overriding is not possible.
 -  If a class is final then it cannot be extended i.e. to child class
 
* A Constructor cannot be declared as final because it is never inherited.

Example:
class Bike{  
 final int speedlimit=90; //final variable  
 void run(){  
  speedlimit=400;  
 }  
 public static void main(String args[]){  
 Bike9 obj=new  Bike9();  
 obj.run();  
 }  
}

Here output is compile time error.

Final variable once declared or initialized can never be changed.
