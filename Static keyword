STATIC keyword:

 - Used in variables, methods and in classes.
 - Static keyword is memory efficient because it gets memory only once.
 - A static method cannot use non-staic data member.
 - this and super keyword cannot be used in static.
 
Example:
class StaticExample{  
static int count=0;//will get memory only once and retain its value  
  
StaticExample(){  
count++;//incrementing the value of static variable  
System.out.println(count);  
}  
  
public static void main(String args[]){  
//creating objects  
StaticExample c1=new StaticExample();  
StaticExample c2=new StaticExample();  
StaticExample c3=new StaticExample();  
}  
}  
OUTPUT:
1
2
3
--------------------
Here count variable is declared as static and it will get memory only once and stores the value.



Q) Why main method in java is static?
 
     * If it were non-static then JVM first creates an object and then calls the method.
     * This will result in extra memory allocation.
     * To make main method memory efficient static keyword is used.
